# Fullstack interview

Candidate has 2 hours to implement the steps below.

The plan is to build a simple frontend to display student's activities from the teacher view.

> Important: Make sure you have your project running before starting the steps.
>  To start, you have helper scripts at the root of this repository for both `server` and `client`

Best of luck :)

## Step0: Install and run the project

As we use node.js for both `server` and `client`, you only have to:
```sh
# At the root of the repository
npm install
```

> Note: this will install `server` and `client`'s dependencies.
> Feel free to look inside the root's package.json for more details.

To start both server and client concurrently:
```sh
# At the root of the repository
npm start
```
> Note: you can still run seperatly `client` and `server` from different terminal windows
> by running `npm start` inside `server` and `client` folder.

There is hot reloading for both `server` and `client`'s code.

## Step1: Create react components

* list of class activities
  * date
  * title
  * number of students that worked on it
* list of student activities
  * date
  * title
  * success rate in %
* student selector
* date range selector

## Step2: Make views mobile friendly

## Step3: Test using Jest
